Now, to get to the point, every man that ever ejaculated has traces of sperm in his penis, sperm is a liquid which means it evaporates all the time and escapes into the atmosphere.

The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species ‚Äì Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.

Also the youtube intros are the bloody WORST. I mean take Minecraft intros and inject them with ultra AIDS and mecha-Ebola. I mean the community is just a tumor in it of itself. Based on this evidence Roblox is more cancer than cancer itself. And since cancer is a mild form of Roblox, cancer is the cure to Roblox. Cancer also has the added benefit of taking you out of your misery if it fails to cure you. In short: GOD IS DEAD AND ROBLOX KILLED HIM!!",
